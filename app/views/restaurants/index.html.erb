    <p>The Food and Beverage (F&B) facilities and services are the key to the success of the Hotel and have to support the marketing. The F&B Division interrelates to all the other divisions of the Hotel hence the logistic has to be well thought. F&B consists of F&B service and preparation. F&B service is headed by the F&B Manager and the food preparation and stewarding is headed by the Executive Chef - Mr. Abri Ali. The Executive Chef shares with the Human Resources Department the responsibility to operate the staff cafeteria.</p>
    <p>To be successful we have to have a good understanding of the market and know the expectations of the Hotelâ€™s potential guests.</p><br/>
